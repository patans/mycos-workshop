The propmt that I used to create this game from ChatGPT.
> Can you create Html and JavaScript code for a game called "High-Low" from following rules.
> - use value from html number input named "howDareYou".
> - detect what user have been bet on from the 3 radio buttons named "whereIPutMyFaith". the expect value should be "low", "mid" and "high"
> - when clicked on "Roll the dice" button should random 3 sets of numbers from 1-6.
> - if the summary of 3 sets of number is below or equal 10 the result is low.
> - if the summary of 3 sets of number is equal 11, it will be mid.
> - if the summary of 3 sets of number is more than 11, it will be high.
> - you will win 2 times of your bet if it high or low and 5 times for the mid. 

For the style I just keep asking ChatGPT like `Create starry night in CSS` then `Also create a Day and cycle between the night`. vice versa.
